  <title>Recommendations</title>
  <shortdesc>This section touches on the few recommendations for improvements we have for this
    group.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>As discussed within the content quality section, there are only four ways in which we would
      improve this project.</p>
    <p> First, a quick scan for typos by each of the members of their group would help ensure
      accuracy in each of their topics. Having multiple sets of eyes is an important asset when
      collaborating on projects, as each person will catch different errors making the final output
      as perfect as possible.</p>
    <p>Second, the short descriptions, as discussed before, will take less than a minute to create,
      and tie your work together so that users can know exactly which page they need to access as
      soon as they arrive at your website. It is a very simple part of the code that makes a huge
      difference to your audience.</p>
