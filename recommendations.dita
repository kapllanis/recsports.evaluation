  <title>Recommendations</title>
  <shortdesc>This section touches on the few recommendations for improvements we have for this
    group.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>As discussed within the content quality section, there are only four ways in which we would
      improve this project.</p>
    <p> First, a quick scan for typos by each of the members of their group would help ensure
      accuracy in each of their topics. Having multiple sets of eyes is an important asset when
      collaborating on projects, as each person will catch different errors making the final output
      as perfect as possible.</p>
